## Introduction 

My last post outlines the process of collecting NFL weather data and injury records to investigate whether turf fields cause more injuries than natural grass, or if other factors are involved. I used ethical web scraping practices to gather data from the NFLWeather website and a Kaggle dataset, then combines and analyzes the data to explore the potential impact of playing surfaces, weather conditions, play type, or position, on player injuries.


## Field Types

All observations on this dataset have been injured so I first wanted to plainly see the number of players getting injured on synthetic fields vs natural fields to see if there is a significant difference. As you can see, not much. With a chi-square test of .36 and a p-value of .54, there shows to be no significant difference between the 2 types of fields at first look. 

AND yes I used a pie chart! Dr. Tass said when you have only 2 types of observations it would be acceptable, and I liked it!

## What could be the cause then?

I then began to dive into what could be the difference maker. If it wasn't the field type what else could it be. I wanted to see if any of the variables in this dataset seemed to stand out and what could be causing so many injuries to the players. 


## Weather 

My first thought was to go to the weather. Perhaps when it’s raining making the field more slippery would be leading to more injuries, and perhaps making all stadiums indoors could help.

Though rain was the lowest at 7 I wanted to see if that was proportionally significant. So, I web-scrapped weather data from “nflweather.com” for the entire 2018 and 2019 seasons with part of my code below.

I found out of the 416 games only 39 (about 9%)  games had any type of moisture (snow, sleet, light rain, rain, etc.)  falls about right in line with the 7% of injuries taking place during rain. Leaving me to belive that weather was a direct factor.


## Could it be Temperature

I next divulged into temperature as being the main cause of injuries. Thinking that cold days could leave the players stiff leading to more injuries. Or on extremely hot days having overly exhausted players could lead to more.

As I looked at this chart I felt like it could be potentially right skewed to I further my investigation with a kernel density estimate chart.

This gave me practically a normal distribution then once I found from my web scrapped data from nflweather.com that the average temperature of an NFL game was 54 degrees. I performed a skewness test to be certain with the code below that gave me .116 leading to me thinking that temperature was not a significant factor in increaseing injuries.

## Is it Position

I next wanted to find is it a certain position. Could there be an increase of injuries for a particular type of player that if we modified could reduce the number of injuries?

In examining the distribution of injuries by position, a particularly intriguing observation emerges. The "Line" position, which includes both offensive and defensive linemen, accounts for approximately 9 out of 22 players on the field during any given play, representing almost 50% of all the players. Despite their prevalence and the perception of line play as being more physically aggressive compared to other positions, linemen exhibit a substantially lower injury rate.

One might anticipate that the physically demanding nature of line play would be associated with a higher likelihood of injury, yet the data indicates otherwise. This surprising finding warrants further investigation into the factors that contribute to injury resilience among linemen, as well as the potential reasons for the discrepancy in injury rates across positions. What about the other 2 positions especially Deffensive skilled players is causing so many more injuries.



Additionally, a stacked bar plot was created to investigate whether synthetic fields contribute to a higher injury rate among skilled positions. The rationale behind this exploration was the assumption that positions requiring players to run in the open field might be more susceptible to injuries due to the field type. By analyzing the relationship between field type and injury occurrence in skilled positions, we can further evaluate the potential impact of field conditions on player safety and performance.

It did not. 

## What really could change

Now I will investigate further in to what is causing more skilled position players to be injured, changing the positions fundamentally could be impractical. The greatest piece of evidence though that I found that is contributing to injuries that could be very easily changed is play type.

![Figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natetheknight75/my386blog/main/assets/images/chart7.png)

I found another dataset that lists every single play type in the 2017 NFL season (kickoff, run, pass, punt.) Kickoffs happened only 2,557 times out of the 35,873 plays in the entire season. Making up only 7% of play types. Yet it is contributing to over a third of all injuries!

In conclusion, the investigation into NFL injuries yielded some unexpected results. The initial assumption that synthetic fields would lead to more injuries was not supported by the data. Instead, the analysis pointed towards play type as a significant factor contributing to player injuries. Kickoffs, which only accounted for 7% of all plays, contributed to over a third of all injuries. This is the factor I believe that can be most easily adjusted with the most change.

Overall, the story of the data indicates that while some assumptions about the causes of player injuries may seem obvious, the reality is often more complex and requires a more nuanced approach. By leveraging data and analytics, we can better understand the factors that contribute to player safety and work towards making changes that can reduce the risk of injury in the NFL.
