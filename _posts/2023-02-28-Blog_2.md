The Age of Surveillance Capitalism" by Shoshana Zuboff is a comprehensive analysis of how the digital economy has transformed into a surveillance economy. The book explores how big tech companies use data surveillance as a means of creating targeted advertisements and how they capitalize on personal information for profit.

What I particularly liked about this book was Zuboff's in-depth research and analysis of the evolution of the digital economy. Her explanation of how surveillance capitalism operates and how it impacts our society is compelling and well-researched. Additionally, her insights into the political and social implications of this economic system are thought-provoking and insightful.

One thing I didn't like about the book was its length and at times, it felt like it was repeating the same ideas over and over. However, given the complexity of the subject, this is understandable, and Zuboff's clear and engaging writing style makes the book easy to follow despite its length.

Overall, "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism" is an important read for anyone interested in understanding the intersection of technology, capitalism, and privacy. Zuboff's thorough research and insightful analysis make this book an essential read for policymakers, academics, and anyone concerned about the impact of big tech on society. However, it is a dense read that requires time and attention, so it may not be suitable for casual readers or those looking for a light read.
