## Introduction 
In my first post on NFL injuires I disscussed the process of collecting NFL weather data and injury records to investigate whether turf fields cause more injuries than natural grass, or if other factors are involved. I used ethical web scraping practices to gather data from the NFLWeather website and a Kaggle dataset, then combines and analyzes the data to explore the potential impact of playing surfaces, weather conditions, play type, or position, on player injuries.

I then discussed the investigation into the potential causes of player injuries in the NFL. While the assumption that synthetic fields would lead to more injuries was not supported by the data, analysis pointed towards another factor. Play type.

## What the Data show's

A comprehensive analysis of NFL injuries revealed surprising insights into the factors contributing to player injuries. Contrary to the initial assumption that synthetic fields might be the primary cause, the data indicated that play type had a more significant impact on injury rates. In particular, kickoffs, which represented only 7% of all plays during the 2017 NFL season, were found to be responsible for over a third of all injuries. This striking disproportion highlights the need for league officials and coaches to reevaluate and potentially adjust the way kickoffs are conducted, in order to mitigate injury risks and safeguard player health.
